    vLLM supports waking weights and KV cache in separate stages. The generic

    point, so a queued partial-rollout request can execute against unmapped NPU
    memory.

    Preserve the explicit ``scheduling`` wake behavior, but otherwise resume
    only after the executor reports that no allocation tags remain asleep.
